# üõ†Ô∏è E-Commerce Microservices Project

This project is a microservices-based e-commerce application built with **Spring Boot**, **Spring Data JPA**, **Spring Security**, **OpenFeign**, and **Kafka**. It provides end-to-end functionality for user management, product catalog, and order/payment workflows.

  - Register, login, and update user details
  - Secure authentication and authorization
- **Product Catalog**
    - CRUD operations for items
    - Fetch single or all items
- **Order Management**
    - Create, update, and cancel orders
    - View orders by user
- **Payment Processing**
    - Submit or refund payment with idempotency control
- **Service Communication**
    - Uses **Spring Cloud OpenFeign** for inter-service REST calls
- **Event-Driven Architecture**
    - **Apache Kafka** integration for asynchronous order and payment events
- **Resiliency**
    - Idempotency key handling for payment APIs
    - Decoupled services to improve fault isolation

## üìÇ System Design

### Architecture
The system is composed of the following microservices:

- **Account Service**  
  Handles user registration, authentication, and profile updates.

- **Item Service**  
  Manages product catalog (CRUD for items).

- **Order Service**  
  Coordinates order creation, updates, and cancellations.  
  Communicates with Item Service and Payment Service using **OpenFeign**.  


- **Payment Service**  
  Processes payments, refunds, and enforces **idempotency**.  
  Listens to order events through **Kafka** for asynchronous processing.

### Inter-Service Communication
- **Synchronous:** REST calls via **OpenFeign** (e.g., Order ‚Üí Item / Payment).
- **Asynchronous:** Event-driven communication with **Kafka** for order/payment events.
